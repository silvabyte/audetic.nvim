{"id":"audetic.nvim-2vc","title":"Continue existing OpenCode session via Lua command","description":"Currently, every new Neovim session creates a fresh OpenCode session. Users want the ability to continue an existing OpenCode session from a previous Neovim session.\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n1. Add a Lua command similar to `status()` that accepts a session ID\n2. Likely add `M.continue_session(session_id)` function to audetic.lua  \n3. Update client.lua to support setting/overriding the pooled session for a project\n4. Store session ID in the session pool to bypass auto-creation\n\n**User-facing API (proposed):**\n```lua\nrequire('audetic').continue_session('session-id-here')\n```\n\nOr via vim command:\n```:AudeticContinue \u003csession-id\u003e```\n\n**Notes:**\n- May need to validate the session ID is still valid on the OpenCode server\n- Consider persisting last session ID somewhere for easy retrieval","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-05T14:28:47.823880195-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-05T14:28:58.032959983-05:00"}
